# UI Utilities

This is a repository of extremely minimal vanilla Javascript UI components. The ultimate goal is to reduce our dependency on external code sources like jQuery and the ZURB Foundation framework, and the technical debt that accrues with using those over time.

Included utilities are:

* tab (for tabbed sections)
* toggle (for accordions and collapsible sections)
